# Incremental Test Trigger - Step 2

✅ **Step 1 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
- Minimal test artifact verified: minimal-test-artifact (261 bytes)
- actions/upload-artifact@v4 confirmed working correctly
- Ready for incremental APK build test

## Step 2 Objective:
Build simple APK and upload with verified actions/upload-artifact@v4

## Expected Results:
1. APK build completes successfully
2. APK artifact appears in downloadable Artifacts section  
3. Confirms full pipeline works before deploying complete AGI system

## Professional Methodology Applied:
✅ Step 1: Isolated problem and tested minimal case
🚀 Step 2: Incremental build with verified components
⏳ Step 3: Full system deployment only after validation
