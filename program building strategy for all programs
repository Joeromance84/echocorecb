      "name": "High-Level Architectural Blueprint",
      "goal": "Define the system's purpose, key components, and their high-level interactions before coding.",
      "steps": [
        "Understand the Core Problem: Clarify the problem and define key functionalities.",
        "Define System Boundaries: Identify major components (client, API, database, external services) and their communication protocols.",
        "Address Non-Functional Requirements: Specify system behaviors for security, performance, scalability, and resilience.",
        "Create a Visual Model: Build diagrams (e.g., flowcharts) showing architecture, data flow, and dependencies."
      ]

    "phase_2": {
      "name": "Build the Core Foundation (The 'Back-End')",
      "goal": "Implement central components and core logic for all future functionality.",
      "steps": [
        "Set Up the Infrastructure: Use containerization/tooling (e.g., Docker) for consistency and portability.",
        "Implement the Core Business Logic: Develop foundational APIs/services, business logic, data storage, and execution engine.",
        "Establish the Communication Protocol: Create secure and efficient communication (e.g., gRPC/WebSocket servers) for front-end and back-end connections.",
        "Create a Minimal Viable Client: Implement a basic client (e.g., ResonantClient) to connect and test backend communication."

    "phase_3": {
      "name": "Develop the User-Facing Layer (The 'Front-End')",
      "goal": "Implement the user interface for user interaction with the system.",
      "steps": [
        "Connect to the Foundation: Use client API/library to connect to the backend.",
        "Design the User Experience: Build UI components (chat boxes, buttons, editors) that reflect backend data.",
        "Integrate Business Logic: Write front-end logic to format, send requests, and display responses."

    "phase_4": {
      "name": "Enhance with Advanced Features",
      "goal": "Add features that build upon the robust foundation for automation, feedback, scale, and optimization.",
      "steps": [
        "Implement Feedback Loops: Add telemetry, logging, and monitoring for performance insights.",
        "Enable Automation: Develop automated loops/processes for command execution.",
        "Scale the System: Add parallel processing and horizontal scaling as throughput grows."
